# Communication
* WhatsApp for quick messages and updates
* Check-in at least twice every week, and at least once the day before assignments are due
* Dealing w/ not communicating: Shall talk with each other after class / during weekly meeting sessions and see if something is wrong, if communication is still not going on well，ask Anya for advice.
* Email for anything formal or longer (e.g., scheduling, documentation)
* Time commitment: apart from the meeting, at least 4 hours/week.

# Conflict resolution
* Bring issues up early and discuss respectfully as a team. 
* Communicate through texting first, and see if it can be communicated through discussions and perhaps office hours
* If team member does not show up, email them or talk after class.
* If we can’t resolve it, we’ll ask the instructor Anya for help.
