# Team D - Carbon & Forests Dashboard: Deforestation and CO₂ Emissions

# Sustainable Development Goal(s): Goal 13: Climate action & Goal 15: Life on land

# Features

## Feature 1: Description of the purpose of the website & Referable data to further look at if interested in the topic.

* Person responsible:
* User story: As a general person interested in sustainability related topics, I can read through the description and further data so that I know what this website wants to show us and have something more to look at if I find myself interested.
* Acceptance Criteria: Highlighted respectively at the start and end of the website individually, normal font size; neutral tone
  
## Feature 2: a graphics World map that shows the correlation between deforestation and CO2 emission from 2000-2025

* Person responsible:
* User story: As a person interested in general deforestation and CO2 emissions, I can use the sliding bar to visualize the development or improvement through time of how strongly deforestation is impacting CO2 emissions.
* Acceptance Criteria: Shows different level of severness of countries through color shading and a sliding bar that compares 2 different eras

## Feature 3: Search Bar for Independent Country Data

* Person responsible: Milly
* User story: As a user, I want to search up each country to independently understand how each country is being affected by deforestation and how the effects of deforestation play a role in carbon emissions without the clutter of a map or scatterplot.
* Acceptance Criteria:
  - Throw out information about the changes in their forests.
  - Throw out information about the changes in their CO2.
  - Show their tree land coverage.
  - Country ranking.

# Data story
  We chose deforestation because forest loss is directly related to biodiversity and climate impacts (SDG 15 +13), and this was both mentioned of interest by Simon and Amery. We chose CO₂ per capita because it is a widely used way to compare emissions responsibilities across countries. We are excited because combining these datasets would build a comparison tool to explore whether high-emitting countries also show high deforestation rates.
